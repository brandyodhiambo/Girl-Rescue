## Libraries

Libraries used in the whole application are:

- [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) - Kotlin is a programming language that can run on JVM. Google has announced Kotlin as one of its officially supported programming languages in Android Studio; and the Android community is migrating at a pace from Java to Kotlin
- [Viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) -The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) -  A lifecycle-aware data holder with the observer pattern
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously
- [Paging 3 library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) -  The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network. This approach allows your app to use both network bandwidth and system resources more efficiently.
- [Retofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit) -  Retrofit is a REST Client for Java and Android by Square inc under Apache 2.0 license. Its a simple network library that used for network transactions. By using this library we can seamlessly capture JSON response from web service/web API.
